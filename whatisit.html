   The birth order theory is proposed by Alfred Adler, an ophthalmologist, stating that there is a correspondence
   between the birth order of an individual and the characteristics that they develop. In this theory, it is
   believed that individuals of different birth order experience the world differently, and these are the experiences
   that their thoughts, behavior, and feeling. This theory uses different standings of individuals in the family as a
   social factor that plays into the development of character. Of course, this would vary across culture, region, and
   religion, but data has shown a pattern between character and birth order. </p>
