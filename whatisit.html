          The birth order theory is proposed by Alfred Adler, an ophthalmologist, stating that there is a correspondence
          between the birth order of an individual and the characteristics that they develop. In this theory, it is
          believed that individuals of different birth order experience the world differently, and these are the experiences
          that their thoughts, behavior, and feeling. This theory uses different standings of individuals in the family as a
          social factor that plays into the development of character. Of course, this would vary across culture, region, and
          religion. There has been debates on whether the correspondence is actually real. Julia M. Rohrer, a German physiologist
          analyszed studies from Germant, the US, and the UK, but found little affects except on the Big Five personalities:
          extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness and conscientiousness. She finds no correlation with more narrower 
          characteristics and argues that this topic is so widely studied because researchers cheery-pick results, making it 
          such a populat cultural theme which seems intuitive to many. Whether this theorey is completely accurate or not, the 
          characteristics would be explored in this website as we can agree that parental resources give rise to various 
          characteristics, where those with similar experiences will be more similar. This means there are always going to be 
          differences in characteristics across culture, region, and family.
