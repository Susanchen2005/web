<h3 id="What is it"> What is it? </h3>
 <p> The birth order theory is proposed by Alfred Adler, an ophthalmologist, stating that there is a correspondence 
    between the birth order of an individual and the characteristics that they develop. In this theory, it is 
    believed that individuals of different birth order experience the world differently, and these are the experiences
    that their thoughts, behavior, and feeling. This theory uses different standings of individuals in the family as a 
    social factor that plays into the development of character. Of course, this would vary across culture, region, and 
    religion, but data has shown a pattern between character and birth order. </p>

  <a href= "https://search.proquest.com/docview/384970112?accountid=36166"> Darwinism. </a> According to Frank Sulloway, 
  life is a competition to make parents notice them. As for the last child, they want to be as different as the first to be 
  able to get their parents to notice them. Additionally, it lies in the household they grew up. They are babies of the family and 
  has everything laid out for them already by the older siblings. Thus, they are more likely to put others into service than 
  themselves. They live an easy life, providing a correlation to the characters they develop.
