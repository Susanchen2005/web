      <h4> Why? </h4>
      <p>
        It is believed that the last child is the most different than the first. This can be traced back to
        <a href= "https://search.proquest.com/docview/384970112?accountid=36166"> Darwinism </a>. According to Frank Sulloway,
        life is a competition to make parents notice them. Sulloway claims that the adaption of different characteristics has a direct connection 
        to Darwinism through his Family Niche Theory. The <a href= "https://search.proquest.com/docview/384970112?accountid=36166"> article </a> 
        was able to summarize this point, stating, “in evolutionary terms, the ability of siblings to survive lies in direct proportion to their 
        ability to make their parents notice them, to construct a niche for themselves”(Shorter). As for the last child, they want to be as 
        different as the first in order to get their parents to notice them. Additionally, the reasoning lies in the environment they grew up in.
        They are babies of the family and has everything laid out for them by the older siblings. Thus, they are more likely to put others into service than
        themselves, take risks, and are more open to change. For example, Benjamin Franklin, the 15th of 17 children, worked in six different fields and 
        Darwin, who is the last born embarked on a voyage to the Beagle, costing the lives of five men, even risking his own life serveral times. 
        Thus, given the easily life they live as a child, it provides a correlation to the actions they take in the future.
