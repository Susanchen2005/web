   <h4> Why? </h4>
  <p>
    It is believed that the last child is the most different than the first. This can be traced back to
   <a href= "https://search.proquest.com/docview/384970112?accountid=36166"> Darwinism. </a> According to Frank Sulloway,
   life is a competition to make parents notice them. As for the last child, they want to be as different as the first to be
   able to get their parents to notice them. Additionally, it lies in the household they grew up. They are babies of the family and
   has everything laid out for them already by the older siblings. Thus, they are more likely to put others into service than
   themselves. They live an easy life, providing a correlation to the characters they develop. </p>
