        This site explores what is known as the Birth Order Theory, a research topic that occured to
        me when I realized the differences between me an my siblings and my similarities to others who
        are the first child. Different parts of the site will explain different aspects of this theorey.
        First, this site explains this theorey and who proposed this. The other sections of this site
        then focuses on the characteristics associated with those that are first born, last born, and
        that of middle child. Each section explains the ideas behing why certain indivudals develop
        certain characteristics and how birth order influences this. The site explains what individuals
        born in different order experiences mentally and socially, which leads to the similarities of
        characteristics developed by individuals born in a similar order. These experiences also dictates
        the reason why, despite being raised by the same two parents, indivudals develop differently. The
        ultimate goal of this site is to present these information in an easy to understand way.
