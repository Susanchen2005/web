        <h4> Why? </h4>
        <p>
          It is believed that these characteristics develop as a direct link to nuture.
          In a <a href= "https://www.psychologies.co.uk/birth-order-effect" > Psychologies aticle </a>, it said that these characteristics
          developed because of the parents' attentiveness with firstborns, making them more concerned about perfection. They are
          constantly the center of attention throughout life, affecting their character. Their high cognitive abilities can be
          linked to the fact that they tutor younger siblings and bear a lot more responsibilities in the household. This leads data
          that shows a average higher IQ by 2 points and the pattern seen in admission data to the top colleges.</p>
